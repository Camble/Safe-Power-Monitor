# Safe-Power-Monitor V1.0a by Camble
based on Popcorn's original GBZ-Power-Monitor

Background
----------
Currently in the GBZ, the power switch works like a normal On/Off switch. The only problem is when you cut the power, it's kinda hard on the system. There's no clean dismounting of the drives. It's really just like yanking the power out. And that's been known to cause corrupted files and disks.


Required Hardware and Components
--------------------------------
- [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/) (or Model B+, Raspberry Pi 2 and Pi 3)
- [Adafruit Powerboost 1000C](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-powerboost-1000c-load-share-usb-charge-boost/overview)
- Safe Shutdown PCB (PowerBoost Edition)
- A mini DPDT slide switch (SK-22H07 included with Safe Shutdown PCB) or an original DMG slide power switch.

Dependencies
-----------
- [Retropie 3.7+](retropie.org.uk) or latest Raspbian
- Python 2.7 and Python Module RPi.GPIO (comes installed with Retropie 3.7)
- omxplayer (comes installed with Retropie 3.7)
- Must be run as a sudoer user (the default Pi user on Retropie 3.7 is a sudoer)

Installation
-----------

You will need to connect the PI Zero to Wifi and from another computer on the same WiFI network, SSH in (or use Putty on PCs):

```
ssh pi@retropie.local
```

Default password is 'raspberry'. At the command prompt, edit the /boot/config.txt file:

```
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```

Add the following line:

```
dtoverlay=gpio-poweroff,gpiopin=22,active_low="y"
```

Press Ctrl+X to exit, hit Y to save and press return.

Next at the command prompt, copy this monitor and the video assets with the following command:

```
cd ~;git clone https://github.com/Camble/GBZ-Power-Monitor_PB.git
```

Now, launch the Monitor manually and test that it's working properly
```
python ~/GBZ-Power-Monitor_PB/gbz_power_monitor.py
```

Once you are satified that the monitor behaves properly, add the monitor to the startup process to complete the installation and then reboot to make it live.

```
echo "@reboot     /usr/bin/nice -n 19 /usr/bin/python ~/GBZ-Power-Monitor_PB/gbz_power_monitor.py" >> mycron; crontab mycron;rm mycron
```

Keeping Up-to-Date
------------------
You can make sure you have the latest updates by issuing this command

```
cd ~/GBZ-Power-Monitor_PB;git pull origin master
```
